When I started downloading the setups already, I had a GitHub account, and I had Visual Studio code with most of the needed extensions so the only thing that I needed was to download the real software of those extensions. 
 I struggled to install Python 3 because, through the installation process, I was supposed to add PATH, but I didnâ€™t so have to uninstall it. Then ADD PATH and do some customizations because I am using Windows 11, so some parts were short.

 Installing package managers like pip i used YouTube because i was trying to meet the deadline.

 Configuring database was an easy job becauese already i had it on my Pc so it was only modifying the configurations.

 Virtualisation i haven't done it because i have to modify my laptop settings.

 for toubleshooting used YouTube .
